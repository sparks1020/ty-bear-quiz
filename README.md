# ty-bear-quiz
find out what TY bear you are with this web-based quiz that accesses the entire list of known TY bears and matches you with the perfect one!

This quiz is written in ASP.Net MVC framework and hooks up to a database filled from a csv of what is assumed to be a near exhaustive list of all Beanie Baby's created.
Fill out the quiz with a few questions and it should return some result of what fits you best.

As it turns out, the data has lots of flaws and missing pieces that has not returned a successful result yet, but the general project and structure is still there.
This is my beginning MVC framework project to get me started and should reflect my work and knowledge albeit a flawed database (that's what you get with info pulled from the internet)
